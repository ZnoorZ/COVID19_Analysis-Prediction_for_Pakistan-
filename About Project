COVID-19: Global EDA and TS Prediction for Pakistan

What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 or novel Corona virus first appeared in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. 
It kept spreading from person to person within China and then it travelled to other countries through its host travelers across the globe. 
Currently, this global pandemic has gained the attention of all the leaders, doctors and scientists. Even the research organisations and 
Data Scientists are not able to ignore this biological creature.

COVID-19 as a Time Series problem: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 261 countries 
and territories around the globe. As of May 14, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with 4.5M confirmed infections and more than 300K reported deaths worldwide. 
The forecasting models that can generate short-term or long-term forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases certainly depends on previous trend and time series data 
thus making it a time series problem.

Milestone for TSP semester project:
The project milestone for this subject is to perform EDA on Global data and time series prediction for Pakistan only.

Other approaches used for this problem:
1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model
2. Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
3. Random Forest
4. SIR (Susceptible – Infected – Removed) model and it’s versions.
Above are some of the models/algorithms that have been used for the same project.

My approach: SIRD I’ve used SIRD model. It’s an extended version of SIR. Basically, The SIR model is based on the dynamics of immunity and transmission among population. 
It is a compartmental model. It separates the population into several compartments. This is a mostly used model to study the behavior of an epidemic. When combined with 
time series data this approach is called the TS-SIR (or sometimes TSIR) model.
• S - Susceptible is a group of people who are vulnerable to exposure with infectious people. 
• I - infectious represents the infected people 
• R - Recovered/ Removed people get immunity so that they are not susceptible to the same illness anymore 
• D – Dead people who died due to the epidemic This Model also has other versions of it like SEIR (Considering the Exposed population). 

Important SIRD time-dependent variables:
➢ N: total population
➢ S(t): number of people susceptible on day t
➢ I(t): number of people infected on day t
➢ R(t): number of people recovered on day t
➢ D(t): number of people dead on day t
➢ β: expected amount of people an infected person infects per day
➢ D: number of days an infected person has and can spread the disease
➢ γ: the proportion of infected recovering per day (γ = 1/D)
➢ α: fatality rate
➢ ρ: rate at which people die (= 1/days from infected until death)

Ordinary Differential Equations (ODES) for SIRD:
These ODEs are based on the change on day t. 
* S’(t) = - β ⋅ I(t) ⋅ S(t) / N 
* R’(t) = γ ⋅ (1-α) ⋅ I(t) 
* I’(t) = β ⋅ I(t) ⋅ S(t) / N - γ ⋅ (1-α) ⋅ I(t) - ρ ⋅ α ⋅ I(t) 
* D’(t) = ρ ⋅ α ⋅ I(t)

Datasets Used:
1- COVID-19 Dataset prepared and formatted by Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
2- Cleaned dataset (Worldwide and USA county-wise) –updated every 24 hours (https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report )
3- Population by country 2020 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020)
4- Pakistan Corona Virus City-wise dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/pakistan-corona-virus-citywise-data)

Feature Selection:
1- Date, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Country and State attributes from “Cleaned dataset for worldwide and USA county-wise cases”.
2- Population and country attributes from “Population by country 2020” dataset
3- Date, Cases, Deaths, Recovered and City

Columns transformed for SIRD equations: 
* comp_df_pk['D'] = comp_df_pk['deaths'] 
* comp_df_pk['R'] = comp_df_pk['recovered'] 
* comp_df_pk['I'] = comp_df_pk['confirmed']- comp_df_pk['R'] - comp_df_pk['D'] 
* comp_df_pk['S'] = comp_df_pk['population']-comp_df_pk['confirmed']

Conclusion: 
Our model has predicted approximately 700K cases in next 2 months after the month of May if people continued the violation of social distancing. 
However, this model is far away from the real-world scenario. Many factors affecting the spread of disease (i.e. proportion of population by age, 
no. of ICU beds and ventilators available, lockdown periods etc) must also be incorporated for better results.
